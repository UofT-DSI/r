## What is EDI?

---

### Diversity

Diversity refers to differences, traits that impact on our perspectives. These include our gender, ethnicity, race, abilities, sexual orientation, age, education, values, beliefs, hobbies, family status, religion and profession.

### Inclusion

Inclusion refers to being respected, valued, welcomed and appreciated for differences.

### Equity

Even if everyone is treated equally, discrimination can occur. Equity is created when all people have access to what they need to succeed.

---

### Stereotypes

Stereotypes are overgeneralized and often inaccurate beliefs about groups of people. We usually learn them from our family, friends, school, and media.

### Bias

A bias is a personal preference, a like or dislike, that interferes with our ability to be impartial or objective.

Unconscious bias happens automatically, when our brains make quick judgments and assessments of people and situations based on previously stored information, including stereotypes.

- Appearance bias: when someone is treated differently based on how they look
- Similarity bias: when we favor people that are like us
- Affinity bias: when we connect with people who have similar experiences
- Confirmation bias: occurs when you interpret information in a way that affirms your prior beliefs or biases and ignores evidence that contradicts them.

### EDI training

EDI training is mandatory at many workplaces, often consisting of the definitions given previously as well as a link to the particular organization's culture, policy, or legal context.

Employees may be quizzed on the content or asked to reflect on their own positionality and intent going forward.
